Project 2 for Software Construction: C++ to Postscript Drawing Commands

-To compile the files through the command line type "make". This will compile everything for the testing code. Then run the executable "./a.out" for the testing program results. testing.ps is the file made from this program.


-See pmain.cpp for an example of implementation of our library. (Must compile this separately with c++14 std flag). output.ps is the file that is made from this example. 

-The design we used for our project is further explained in the design document.
